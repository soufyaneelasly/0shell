Caused by:
  feature `edition2024` is required

  The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.75.0).
  Consider adding `cargo-features = ["edition2024"]` to the top of Cargo.toml (above the [package] table) to tell Cargo you are opting in to use this unstable feature.
  See https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#edition-2024 for more information about the status of this feature.
